Home page: http://sarrazip.com/dev/cmoc.html

License

    See the file COPYING. Note that it does not apply to the files
    under src/usim-0.91-cmoc.

Installation

    See the file INSTALL. If using the FrankASM 6809 assembler
    (as6809), it should already have been installed. CMOC can also
    use LWTOOLS' lwasm. See the home page for details.

Automake

    To do CMOC development, GNU Automake 1.12 or later is required
    (previous versions generate src/parser.h instead of src/parser.hh).
